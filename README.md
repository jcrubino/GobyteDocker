# GobyteDocker
Dockerfiles for building and running [Gobyte](https://www.gobyte.network/) node and masternode containers for local regression tests; or for easier deployments.
Currently build-flow is in stages to easily configure up-to-date images as needed.
Can be done in one step, with Alpine lib removals during build process.
